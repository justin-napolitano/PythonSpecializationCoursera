#10.6 Using "with" for files
with open('mydata.txt', 'r') as md:
    for line in md:
        print(line)
# continue on with other code

md = open('mydata.txt', 'r')
for line in md:
    print(line)
md.close()
# continue with other code


#The Two are equivalent.  With statements are probably more common and a better idiom to use
